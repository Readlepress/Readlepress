# Readle Press  
## NEP 2020 Implementation Partner for Schools 🇮🇳

> **We help schools implement NEP 2020 meaningfully — from policy to classroom practice.**

Readle Press is an education-focused **design and technology initiative** built to support Indian schools in translating the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** into **real, measurable classroom outcomes**.

We are **not** an LMS vendor.  
We are **not** a content marketplace.

We work with schools as a **policy-to-practice NEP 2020 implementation partner**.

---

## What We Do

Indian schools face a clear challenge today:

> **NEP 2020 is visionary — but implementation is complex.**

Readle Press exists to bridge this gap.

We help schools move from:

- **Policy documents → Classroom systems**
- **Marksheets → Holistic progress**
- **Rote learning → Competency-based education**
