Readle Press
NEP 2020 Implementation Partner for Schools 🇮🇳

We help schools implement NEP 2020 meaningfully — from policy to classroom practice.

Readle Press is an education-focused design and technology initiative built to support Indian schools in translating the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 into real, measurable classroom outcomes.

We are not an LMS vendor.
We are not a content marketplace.

We work with schools as a policy-to-practice implementation partner.

What We Do

Indian schools face a clear challenge today:

NEP 2020 is visionary — but implementation is complex.

Readle Press exists to bridge this gap.

We help schools move from:

policy documents → classroom systems

marksheets → holistic progress

rote learning → competency-based education

Our Focus Areas (NEP 2020–Aligned)
🧭 NEP Readiness & Implementation

We help schools understand where they are, what NEP expects, and how to move forward with a clear, stage-wise roadmap.

How We Work With Schools

1. Audit & Understanding
We assess current practices against NEP 2020 expectations.

2. Design & Setup
We design systems — digital, pedagogical, and visual — aligned to school context.

3. Support & Evolve
We stay engaged to help schools refine, adapt, and sustain implementation.

Design & Philosophy

Education-first, not startup-tech

Calm, human, school-friendly design

Illustration-led learning experiences

Technology that supports pedagogy — not the other way around

We believe good education systems feel quiet, clear, and confident.
